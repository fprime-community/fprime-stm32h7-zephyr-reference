# fprime-stm32h7-zephyr-reference F' project
> [!Note]
> This deployment by default builds for the NUCLEO-H723ZG development board and has been verified on macOS and on Windows 11 using WSL (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS). 
> 
> If you are using another board, please follow the steps found [here](#specifying-zephyr-board-configuration). Also, the device tree nodes in `Main.cpp` and `ReferenceDeploymentTopology.cpp` for the serial port and LEDs may need to be updated depending on your zephyr board configuration. For example, the `usart3` node is set `Main.cpp` for the `NUCLEO-H723ZG` board.

## System Requirements

- F Prime System Requirements listed [here](https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/getting-started/installing-fprime/#system-requirements)
- Zephyr dependencies listed [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)
- Minimum required **CMake version: 3.27.0**

> If your system CMake is older than 3.27, it **must be upgraded**. On WSL, this must be often done manually.

>[!Note]
> For users using WSL please see important instructions below under section **WSL (Windows 11) Notes**

## Prerequisites
1. Follow the [Hello World Tutorial](https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/tutorials-hello-world/docs/hello-world/)
2. Follow the [Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html). Ensure that the Zephyr SDK is installed.
3. Install the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html`). More information can be found [here](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32/wiki/Upload-methods)

> [!Warning]
> If you installed the ARM version of the STM32CubeProgrammer, please follow the steps provided [here](./docs/Arduino-STM32CubeProgrammer-Arm-Issue.md)

4. Install the stm32 board manager. You can reference the guide [here](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino/blob/main/docs/arduino-cli-install.md).


## Initial Project Setup

> [!NOTE]
> The `setup.sh` script can be used to build and install all required dependencies for this project and assumes the prerequesite steps have been completed. This script has only been tested on MacOS. Bash is required to run this script. To run the script, run `bash setup.sh`. Be sure to activate the fprime-venv created by this script. If this script is run successfully, the `Initial Project Setup` and `Building and Running the ReferenceDeployment Application` steps can be skipped.

<!-- TODO: UPDATE REPO NAME -->
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-stm32h7-zephyr-reference.git
```

2. Fetch git submodules
```sh
# In fprime-stm32h7-zephyr-reference
git submodule update --recursive --init
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not installed the [Zephyr SDK](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/toolchains/zephyr_sdk.html#toolchain-zephyr-sdk), please install it now:
> ```shell
> # In fprime-stm32h7-zephyr-reference
> cd ./lib/zephyr-workspace/zephyr
> west sdk install
> ```

3. In the project directory, create a virtual environment
```sh
# In fprime-stm32h7-zephyr-reference
python3 -m venv fprime-venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment
```sh
# In fprime-stm32h7-zephyr-reference
# Linux, MacOS, & Windows WSL
source fprime-venv/bin/activate
```

5. With the virtual environment activated, install the requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Navigate to the `zephyr-workspace` directory to set up zephyr
```sh
# In fprime-stm32h7-zephyr-reference
cd lib/zephyr-workspace

# Run the following commands
west update
west zephyr-export
```

## Building and Running the ReferenceDeployment Application
> [!Note]
> This step can be skipped if the setup.sh script is run. However, any changes made will require you to run `fprime-util build` and may require `fprime-util generate`

1. In order to build the ReferenceDeployment application, or any other FÂ´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```sh
# In fprime-stm32h7-zephyr-reference
fprime-util generate
```

2. The next step is to build the ReferenceDeployment application's code.
```sh
# In fprime-stm32h7-zephyr-reference
fprime-util build
```

## Flashing the NUCLEO H723ZG development board
```sh
# In fprime-stm32h7-zephyr-reference

# Linux/Windows WSL
sh ~/.arduino15/packages/STMicroelectronics/tools/STM32Tools/2.3.0/stm32CubeProg.sh -i swd -f build-fprime-automatic-zephyr/zephyr/zephyr.hex -c /dev/ttyACM0

# MacOS
sh ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/STMicroelectronics/tools/STM32Tools/2.3.0/stm32CubeProg.sh -i swd -f build-fprime-automatic-zephyr/zephyr/zephyr.hex -c /dev/cu.usbmodem142203 
```

> [!Note]
> Change `/dev/ttyACM0` (`/dev/cu.usbmodem141203` for MacOS) to the correct serial device connected to the device. To find the correct serial port, refer to thie documentation [here](https://github.com/ngcp-project/gcs-infrastructure/blob/d34eeba4eb547a5174d291a64b36eaa8c11369c8/Communication/XBee/docs/serial_port.md)

> [!Note]
> Two USB connections are required. USB PWR is used to power and flash the development board and access the debug terminal, USER USB is used to connect to the F Prime GDS

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```sh
# In top level project directory
fprime-gds -n --dictionary ./build-artifacts/zephyr/fprime-zephyr-deployment/dict/ReferenceDeploymentTopologyDictionary.json --communication-selection uart --uart-device /dev/cu.usbmodem142101 --uart-baud 115200 
```

> [!Note]
> `/dev/cu.usbmodem142101` will likely need to be replaced with the correct port. This can be found by running the following command: `ls -l /dev/cu.usb*`

## Specifying Zephyr Board Configuration
This reference deployent can be used for any board running zephyr so long as the correct zephyr board configuration is provided. In order to specify the board to build for, update the `BOARD` option in the `settings.ini` file to the correct board name.


```ini
BOARD=nucleo_h723zg # Example for the NUCLEO-H723ZG, which is supported by zephyr
```

A list of supported boards can be found [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html#).

> [!NOTE]
> The config file in `./lib/zephyr-workspace/.west/` may need to be updated in order to install the correct board configurations. This deployment by default only installs the board configurations for hal_stm32 boards.

### Using Custom Board Configurations
Using a custom board configuration may require updating the CMakeLists.txt file. This repository appends the following board root which contains a board configuration for the STM32H753I-EVAL board.

```cmake
list(APPEND BOARD_ROOT "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/fprime-stm32h7-zephyr")
```

Make sure to update the path to match the location of your custom board configuration if needed. More information on creating custom board configurations can be found on zephyr's official documentation [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/hardware/porting/board_porting.html).

## WSL (Windows 11) Notes
WSL doesn't natively have access to USB devices. To flash the board properly and allow the GDS to communicate with the deployment board via UART over USB, follow these one-time steps

1. On Powershell as administrator, install and run **usbipd-win**: 
Run Powershell as administrator 
```
winget install dorssel.usbipd-win 
```

2. On Powershell find your USB device:
```
usbipd list
```
> [!Note]
> You should see two STM32 devices listed with different BUSID's. One corresponds to the USB PWR and the other to USER USB.

3. On Powershell bind both devices to USBIPD in two seperate commands (as administrator):
```
usbipd bind --busid <BUSID_USB_PWR> --wsl
```

```
usbipd bind --busid <BUSID_USER_USB> --wsl
```

5. On WSL confirm visibility of USB device:
```
ls /dev/ttyACM*
```
> [!Note]
> On WSL, the device will usually appear as /dev/ttyACM0. You can check using ls /dev/ttyACM*
